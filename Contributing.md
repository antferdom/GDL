HI everyone!
If you're interested in joining the community to build a better understanding of the subjacent theoretical principles governing Deep Learning studying its symmetries , there are lots of ways of contributing; big and small:

- Star this repo.
- Send a link of **GDL** to a couple of people whose opinion you respect and broad the knowledge about the theory.
- Contribute towards the formalism and legibility of the content: Create an issue mentioning the finded and upcoming modifications to the chosen chapter or set of them. Then conclude the addition to the repo via pull request.
- Expand the content: If you are willing to change, modify, delete or add additional and new content to any corpus of any chapter, follow as dictated in the previous mechanism. Always use the PR procedure of integration if possible.
